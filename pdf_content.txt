Before We Code: The Right Way to Analyze Data
Data Analysis is Like Being a Detective
1Survey the Scene: Understand what data you have
2Look for Clues: Identify patterns and issues
3Follow Evidence: Analyze relationships systematically
4Draw Conclusions: Interpret findings meaningfully
The Golden Rule
Never start analyzing data without first understanding what you’re working with!

Step 1: Data Understanding with AI
AI Prompt for Data Overview
"I have a new dataset called ’UM C192021.csv’. Before I analyze it, help
me understand what I’m working with. What questions should I ask about
this data first?"
What AI Should Help You Discover
What does this dataset represent?
How many records and columns?
What are the column names and meanings?
What time period does it cover?
What is the main purpose?

The Art of Data Storytelling
Data Presentation is Like Being a Storyteller
1Know Your Audience: Who are you presenting to?
2Structure Your Narrative: Beginning, middle, and end
3Choose Right Evidence: Which data supports your story?
4Make It Memorable: How will audience remember key points?
The Golden Rule
Your data should tell a story, not just show numbers!

Planning Your Data Presentation
AI Prompt for Audience Analysis
"I want to present my COVID-19 data analysis findings. Help me think about
who my audience might be and what they would care about most."
Consider These Questions
Who needs to see this data? (Administrators, public health officials, students?)
How familiar is your audience with data analysis?
What aspects would be most relevant to them?
What decisions might they make based on your presentation?

Effective AI Prompting for Data Analysis
Prompt Structure That Works
1Start with Understanding: ”Help me understand what I’m looking at...”
2Ask for Guidance: ”What should I consider when...”
3Request Systematic Approach: ”How should I approach...”
4Seek Interpretation Help: ”What does this tell me about...”
